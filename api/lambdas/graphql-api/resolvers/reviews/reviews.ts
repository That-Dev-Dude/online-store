      'The more I use my bag the more I love it. I love the laptop sleeve I can use for both my computer and to keep documents safe and it still has plenty of room to throw my random things in the middle. Which right now consists of everything from the new contact lens boxes I got to my wireless keyboard and wireless mouse I take back and forth to the office.',
